This code is an app created to provide more peace of mind to many parents in caring for their children using smartphones. 
 The main function is: First, when the mobile phone is turned on and steps are detected, a character appears at the top of the screen to prevent the user from looking at the mobile phone.
 Second, when the cell phone detects light below a certain value, the cell phone is locked.
When walking, we made it so that only the character appears when you have to use your cell phone for unavoidable reasons, such as answering a phone call. We also made it so that you lock your cell phone when it is dark, thinking that it is time to use your cell phone before going to bed.

This is for simple testing and demonstration purposes and may not work on devices with the latest version of security. Only devices with security versions prior to 2017 may work.
